# SpecialRelativityVisualizer
A simple tool to visualize special relativity.

May be filled with bugs. Feel free to report them or request more features! (though I can't guarantee to implement it)

Also, you can edit the project yourself if you choose `Edit` instead of `Run` in step 4 below. All the code is in Main.gd, so feel free to look at it or change it.

### How to use
1. Download [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/kinokomushroom/SpecialRelativityVisualizer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip.
3. Start Godot Engine and press `Import`, and choose the `project.godot` file inside the unzipped folder.
4. Click `Import & Edit`, Restart Godot Engine, choose the `Special Relativity Visualizer` project, then hit `Run`.
